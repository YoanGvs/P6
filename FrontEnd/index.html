			<h1 id="titlemodal">Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</h1>
			<p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Kif might!</p>
			<p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. <strong> That's so cute.</strong> <em> No, just a regular mistake.</em> One hundred dollars.</p>
			<h2>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</h2>
			<p>No. We're on the top. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I'm a thing.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</li><li>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</li><li>Also Zoidberg.</li>
			</ol>
			<input type="text">
			<h3>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</h3>
			<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</li><li>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</li><li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
			<p>Bender, we're trying our best. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Look, last night was a mistake. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</p>
			<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Bender, we're trying our best. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
			<p>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
			<p>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Soon enough. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
			<p>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. You are the last hope of the universe. File not found. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
			<p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Also Zoidberg. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? It must be wonderful.</p>
			<p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! I'll get my kit! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
			<p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
			<p>Meh. No, I'm Santa Claus! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. When will that be? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
			<p>Why would a robot need to drink? It must be wonderful. Look, last night was a mistake. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
